A Unit Converter

Basically an excuse to do stuff in C.

TODO:
Decide on a data structure.
Possibilities:
Hash Map        - Base it off of a linked list, though
Linked List     - Easy.
Harder to save:
BST             - How would I even organize this
Tree            - Probably makes the most sense

Make the Math Parser.

Finished:
Read config files, have a basic shell-like interface.
